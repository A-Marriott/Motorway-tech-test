This app allows you to retrieve a JSON of dummy vehicle data.

In order to run this app, make sure you have npm installed, which you can do following the guide [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Once youâ€™ve pulled the repo and navigated to the folder in your CLI, run the following commands:

```
npm install
node app.js
```

The app should now be running, and you can retrieve the JSON list by going to the url:
http://localhost:3000/api/vehicles
